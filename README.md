1) Answer - 1 
2) No
3) No, there is quite a few parts involved here as it needs to test writing sending and receiving a message which would be better tested with E2E testing as it can test the whole process.
4) Yes, this is a simple test and only really one part involved (the length of the message) and thus it would be easy to test with a Unit test.
